# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project
In this repository you will find my solution to the Arcade Game project from Udacity's Front End Nanodegree. This project explores basic concepts regarding Javascript, Object Oriented Programming by initializing and controlling entities within a small arcade game.

## Instructions
### How to run the game?
1. Download the folder (through ```git clone https://github.com/naorpeled/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game.git``` or by downloading the zip file through the reposity on *Github*)
2. Open ```index.html``` and start playing :D

### How to play
Move on the game board and try to get through the water while not colliding with the enemy bugs.
If you collide with one of them you automatically get teleported to the beginning spawn point.
Once you reach the water and pass them you win.

#### Controls:
upArrowKey - Moves the player one block up

downArrowKey - Moves the player one block down

rightArrowKey - Moves the player one block right

leftArrowKey - Moves the player one block left


## TODO:
- Add a winning sound/notification
- Add game difficulty once the player has passed the water
- Add a score system
- Add a timer
